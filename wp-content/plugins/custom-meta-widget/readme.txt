Clone of the standard Meta widget plus option to hide log in/out, admin, feed and WordPress links.

== Description ==

The standard Meta widget that comes with WordPress offers no customization and requires you to show all 5 links on the sidebar (register, login, entries rss, comments rss, and wordpress.org).

This plugin acts in exactly the same way as the standard Meta widget EXCEPT that it adds options to the widget's setup page which allow you to HIDE any of these 5 links.

== Installation ==

1. Download the latest zip file and extract the `custom-meta-widget` directory.
2. Upload this directory inside your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the 'Custom Meta Widget' on the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. Add the 'Custom Meta' widget to your sidebar (using the Appearance > Widgets menu) and choose which links you want hidden from the sidebar.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why does my Meta widget look the same? =

This plugin does not modify the standard WordPress Meta widget. It is a completely seperate widget titled 'Custom Meta.' If you are currently using the standard Meta widget, you will have to replace it with the Custom Meta widget on the Appearance > Widgets menu.

= Which links can I hide? =

You can remove any, all, or none of the links which appear on the standard Meta widget.

= Why did you make this? =

I didn't like having the 'Comments RSS' link on the sidebar, but did like having the rest of them. I couldn't find a plugin to do that and manually editing the code to accomplish this is a dirty hack and breaks with every update, so I created a crude plugin to remove just the 'Comments RSS' link. I then cleaned this up and added an options page for all the links so that no one else would have to do this in the future.

= Can you add this feature I just thought of? =

Can I? Yes. Will I? Yes, if I think it would be a helpful addition. I'm trying to keep things clean and simple, but there's always room for improvement, so let me know if you think a feature is lacking!

== Screenshots ==
